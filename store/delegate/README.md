# Delegate Store

**This is a placeholder for a delegated store**

The delegate store gets stored values from other indexers instead of from a value store.  An indexer can serve as a caching-only indexer in an indexer hierarchy by creating the indexer with a delegate store.

A delegate store does not store values, but may maintain a temporarily negative cache.
